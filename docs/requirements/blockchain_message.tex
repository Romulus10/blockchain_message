\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Features Overview}
\subsection{Security and Privacy}

\section{User Interface Specification}
The UI will have three levels during development, starting with a command-line interface.

\subsection{Command-Line Interface}
The CLI will accept a few simple commands for interacting with the blockchain\_message system. On running the program, you will be met by a login screen to prompt for a user address, a username, and an email address. These three elements will be used to identify you to the network while exchanging messages.
The interface commands are as follows:

\texttt{write}

\texttt{check}

\texttt{read}

\texttt{new-contact}

\texttt{exit}

\subsection{HTML5 Interface}
The HTML5-based interface will expose all of the same functionality as the command-line interface.

\subsection{Android Application}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}
\subsection{Software Requirements}
The first version of the blockchain\_message command-line interface is designed to run on Linux, but with tweaking can be made to run on any system with Python installed. 

The system requires that an Ethereum node be accessible, which can be either set up on the local machine through Parity or Geth or exposed through a service such as Infura.io.

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
\paragraph{If Using a Local Ethereum Node}
If Parity, Geth, or a similar Ethereum node is running on the local machine, blockchain\_message requires available resources for both the appliation itself and the Ethereum node. The entire Ethereum blockchain will require approximately 300 gigabytes of disk space and 4 gigabyte of available memory.

\paragraph{blockchain\_message Requirements}
The blockchain\_message process itself will require 250 megabytes of available disk space.
